## A little bit about me

🌱 &nbsp;I recently finished a project utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game by analyzing the screen and automatically updating the score without human intervention. [The repository is now public!](https://github.com/gcmaidana/Visionwatch) The next project I will be working on is a Gameboy Emulator. I'm not sure if I'll use C++ or C, I'm still in the research phase, I haven't written any code yet! \
👷  &nbsp;I am interesting in solving meaningful problems that have a direct impact on people. \
🎓 &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing games, solving [LeetCode problems](https://github.com/gcmaidana/LeetCode-Solutions/tree/main) and spending time with family.\
