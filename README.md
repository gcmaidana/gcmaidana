## Hello!

🌱 &nbsp;I recently finished a project utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game by analyzing the screen and automatically updating the score without human intervention. [The repository is now public!](https://github.com/gcmaidana/Visionwatch) \
🎓 &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
✉️ &nbsp;You can drop me an email at geanmaidana@outlook.com"!
