## Hello!
💻 &nbsp;I recently finished a project where I re-made [Pong from scratch using SDL2, C++ and CMAKE](https://github.com/gcmaidana/SDL2-Pong). The game is simple because the point of the project was to fiddle around with SDL2 a little bit to understand low leveling rendering a bit better before I get into making my own [Real Time Rendering Engine using OpenGL](https://github.com/gcmaidana/MAGE). This will intially be a simple, basic rendering engine, and over time I want to extend it and add more features to make it a game engine. \
🌱 &nbsp;I have a few other cool projects you can check out if you are interested in, like the [Visionwatch project](https://github.com/gcmaidana/Visionwatch) I made utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game by analyzing the screen and automatically updating the score without human intervention. \
🎓 &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
