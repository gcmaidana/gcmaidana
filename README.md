## A little bit about me

üå± &nbsp;I'm currently working on a project utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game by analyzing the screen and automatically updating the score without human intervention. [The repository is now public!](https://github.com/gcmaidana/Visionwatch) I am also working through a [UE5 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=%2FjZHTpnCvx8&ranSiteID=_jZHTpnCvx8-iYftg8SgyHyKKfy6rmwnIQ&LSNPUBID=%2FjZHTpnCvx8&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads&couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). I don't plan on showing anything off until I'm done with the UE5 course because UE5 projects tend to be VERY large due to assets and such, so it would be a hassle to constantly compress/delete unnecessary things to upload to GitHub (since GitHub has file size limitations). \
üë∑  &nbsp;I am interesting in solving meaningful problems that have a direct impact on people. \
üéì &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing games, solving [LeetCode problems](https://github.com/gcmaidana/LeetCode-Solutions/tree/main) and spending time with family.\
‚úâÔ∏è &nbsp;You can drop me an email at geanmaidana@outlook.com with a subject containing "GitHub: ..."! It will be a pleasure to talk with you!
