## A little bit about me

🌱 &nbsp;I'm currently working on a project utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game by analyzing the screen and automatically updating the score without human intervention (repo is not currently public). I am also working through a UE5 course. \
🎓 &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing games, solving [LeetCode problems](https://github.com/gcmaidana/LeetCode-Solutions/tree/main) and spending time with family.\
✉️ &nbsp;You can drop me an email at geanmaidana@outlook.com with a subject containing "GitHub: ..."! It will be a pleasure to talk with you!
