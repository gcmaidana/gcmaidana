## A little bit about me

üå± &nbsp;I'm currently working on a project utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game by analyzing the screen and automatically updating the score without human intervention. [The repository is now public!](https://github.com/gcmaidana/Visionwatch) I am also working through a [UE5 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=%2FjZHTpnCvx8&ranSiteID=_jZHTpnCvx8-iYftg8SgyHyKKfy6rmwnIQ&LSNPUBID=%2FjZHTpnCvx8&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads&couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). I don't plan on showing anything off until I'm done with the UE5 course because UE5 projects tend to be VERY large due to assets and such, so it would be a hassle to constantly compress/delete unnecessary things to upload to GitHub (since GitHub has file size limitations). \
üë∑  &nbsp;I am interesting in solving meaningful problems that have a direct impact on people. \
üéì &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing games, solving [LeetCode problems](https://github.com/gcmaidana/LeetCode-Solutions/tree/main) and spending time with family.\
‚úâÔ∏è &nbsp;You can drop me an email at geanmaidana@outlook.com with a subject containing "GitHub: ..."! It will be a pleasure to talk with you!

Regarding what I'm currently or planning to work on (none of these are public repos):
- Working on a project which detects wins, losses or draws in a game of Overwatch using OpenCV and Tesseract (Current)
- 3D Game Engine, likely in OpenGL (Planned)
- A game written in assembly (Planned)

I've gotten this question once before, so I thought I should answer it here. The reason a lot of my projects are related to games is because I find it easy to come up with ideas when it relates to games. One thing about projects is that I like them to have some level of utility, so if no one cares or likes the projects I make, at least I do, which is why I generally use games as a source for brainstorming projects. I would like to work in the games industry, but I am open to other industries as well.
