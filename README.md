## A little bit about me

🎓 &nbsp;I'm currently working on a project utilizing OpenCV and Tesseract to detect wins or losses in a video game and automatically update the score without human intervention. I am also working through a UE5 course. \
🌱 &nbsp;I would like to eventually continue my education and get my Master's and perhaps my PhD in the future.\
✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing games, solving [LeetCode problems](https://github.com/gcmaidana/LeetCode-Solutions/tree/main) and spending time with family.\
💬 &nbsp;Lets have a Meet or Zoom call, feel free to pick a slot on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/mmphego/30min) to talk with me.\
✉️ &nbsp;You can drop me an email at geanmaidana@outlook.com with a subject containing "GitHub: ..."! It will be a pleasure to talk with you!.\
